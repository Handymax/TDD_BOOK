# main difference between my project and the TDD-Course

## Chapter 01

1. TDD-BOOK using python3.6 and Firefox, I using python3.7 and Chrome. So the there is not a geckodriver.log in my project.

## Chapter 09&10

1. TDD-BOOK use superlists-staging.ottg.eu, but in my project, I use staging.qicai21.cn instead. And I'm using this sitename in everywhere such as nginx config and foldpath.
